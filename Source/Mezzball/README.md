# Mezzball
[Play here](https://jenniedalgren.github.io/jezzball/)
My First Javascript Game. Developed while attending the IRONHACK Bootcamp, Barcelona. 

It's a tribute to an old game from the ninties called [Jezzball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JezzBall)
## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JAVASCRIPT
* JQUERY
## Approach
When I decided to build this game I got the suggestion to use Canvas. I'd never used that before so I tried to read up on what Canvas is and how it's used. 

My goal was to make the game work with one ball and the walls. Everything else was a bonus.
## Features
* Welcome screen with animated text
* Ball(s) that moves and bounces against the wall
* Walls that changes the game area
* Timer 
* Levels with level up sound.
* Cleared area calculator
* Game Over screen with gif. 
* Automatic restart if game over.
* Cursor toggle to indicate if creating a vertical or horizontal wall.
## Unsolved
- [ ] Make the wall work with multiple balls; change the game area into array and use multiple game areas when necessary.
- [ ] Bug when you create two walls on left side of ball.
## Future Implementation
- [ ] More sound effects.
- [ ] Responsiveness.
- [ ] Highscore.
